    <p>Hey thanks for visiting!</p>
    <p>
      This is just a simple project displaying my top ten albums over a number of years. I love
      music and obsessively rank my favorite albums in my head each year. I thought it might be a
      fun personal project to develop a fancy little page that shows off my AJAX/JSON talents.

      You can begin your journey by clicking on a year up above. From there, you can either click
      through or use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate around the page.
